# COSC2436 HW0

# Letter Frequency Counter Program

## Goal
This program reads a string from an input file, counts the frequency of each letter (ignoring spaces and treating uppercase and lowercase letters as the same), and outputs the results to an output file. The output is printed in the order the letters first appear in the string.

## Input
The program reads a string from an input file. The string can include uppercase and lowercase letters as well as spaces. Spaces are ignored, and letter case does not affect the counting (i.e., 'a' and 'A' are considered the same).

### Example Input:
“Hey welcome to this class” 

### Example Output:
H 2
E 3 
Y 1
W 1
L 2
